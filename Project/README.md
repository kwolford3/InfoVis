Data Topic:
We are hoping to explore the vast amount of data that tracks STEM education throughout the different levels of education. Our current source looks into categories such as math/science proficiency, school spending on the subjects, and comparisons to other countries, but there are other areas of STEM education that we may incorporate into our visualization.
